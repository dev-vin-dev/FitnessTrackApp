# FitnessTrackApp

## ðŸ“Œ Idea
I decided to work on a **Fitness Tracker** app.  
The app will help users track their workouts and fitness progress over time.  
Users can log exercises, sets, reps, and weights, and view their workout history.  
The app will also fetch exercise details from the **Tredict API**.  

The design will be simple and mobile-friendly using **Tailwind CSS**.  
I will deploy the app on **Vercel**.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Log Workouts** â€“ Add exercises with sets, reps, and weights.
- **View History** â€“ See all workouts done in the past.
- **Progress Tracking** â€“ Display progress over time.
- **Exercise Data** â€“ Fetch exercise info from Tredict API.
- **Responsive Design** â€“ Looks good on mobile and desktop (Tailwind CSS).
- **Deployed Online** â€“ Hosted on Vercel for easy access.

## ðŸ”— API
I will use the **Tredict API** to get exercise and workout-related data.

## ðŸ›  React Components
Here are some components I think will be needed:
- **Navbar** â€“ For navigation between pages.
- **WorkoutForm** â€“ To log a workout.
- **WorkoutList** â€“ To display all logged workouts.
- **WorkoutItem** â€“ For each workout in the list.
- **ProgressChart** â€“ To show progress visually.
- **ExerciseSearch** â€“ To search exercises from Tredict API.
- **ExerciseDetails** â€“ To view exercise details from API.
- **Footer** â€“ Basic footer info.

## ðŸš€ Deployment
- The app will be deployed on **Vercel** after building.
- It will be easy to access and share.
